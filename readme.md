ReactJS Tutorial Series
=======================

`react-tutorial-series` is a project created by me for all JS lovers who want to learn ReactJS. I have covered most of the topics (from basic to advance level) by creating small apps, every app has self explanatory code in it. The USP of this project it, most of the concepts are explained using `Class` and `Functional` approach side by side. It also has Redux with Thunk examples in both `Class` and `Functional` approach.

Folder structure
----------------
The root project folder have many sub-foldfers, every sub-folder have a ReactJS app in it whose name describe the topic which it covers. You just have to install the node packages in it and it will run the app.


How to use
----------

Download or Clone the root project folder, under every sub-folder you will find a ReactJS app, go to that folder and run following command:

`npm install`

and you are good to go.

Do let me know if you will find some error in any app or if you find some topic needs to be added.

Happy coding :)
